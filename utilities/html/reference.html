  <h2>Function Reference</h2>

  <p>
    The following is a reference for the functions available in the Complex Number Calculator:
  </p>

  <p>
    The complex number calculator is a tool that 
allows users to perform operations on complex numbers, 
which are numbers that consist of a real part and an imaginary part. T
he calculator supports the following operations: <br> <br>

Addition: This operation allows users to add two complex numbers together. 
For example, if the user wants to add the 
complex numbers 3 + 2i and 4 + 5i, the result would be 7 + 7i.<br> <br>

Subtraction: This operation allows users to subtract one complex number from 
another. For example, if the user wants to 
subtract the complex number 4 + 5i from the 
complex number 3 + 2i, the result would be -1 - 3i.<br> <br>


Multiplication: This operation allows users to multiply two complex numbers 
together. For example, if the user wants to 
multiply the complex numbers 3 + 2i and 4 + 5i, the result would be -7 + 22i.<br> <br>

Division: This operation allows users to divide one complex number by 
another. For example, if the user wants to
 divide the complex number 3 + 2i by the complex number 
4 + 5i, the result would be 0.72 + 0.04i.<br> <br>

Inverse: This operation allows users to find the inverse of a 
complex number. The inverse of a complex number is defined as the
 number multiplied by its complex conjugate, divided by 
the square of its magnitude. For example, if the user wants
 to find the inverse of the complex number 3 + 2i, the result would
 be 0.36 - 0.48i.<br> <br>

Imaginary: This operation allows users to get the imaginary
 portion of any real, imaginary or complex number. For example, 
if the user wants to get the imaginary part of the number 3, the 
result would be 0. If the user wanted the imaginary part of -2i it 
would be -2i and if they wanted the imaginary part of (5+2i) it would be 2i.<br> <br>

Logarithm: This operation allows users to find the natural logarithm 
of a complex, imaginary or real number. For example, if the user wants 
to find the logarithm of the complex number 100 + 10i, the result would
 be (4.61...+0.099...i) <br> <br>

Exponents: This operation allows users to raise a complex, imaginary or 
real number to a given exponent. The exponent of a complex number is 
defined as the number that the complex number is multiplied by itself the 
specified number of times. For example, if the user wants to raise the 
complex number 2 + 3i to the exponent 2, the result would be (-5+12i) <br> <br>

Square Root: This operation allows users to find the 
square root of a complex number. The square root of a 
complex number is defined as the number that, 
when multiplied by itself, equals the original complex number.
 For example, if the user wants to find the square root of the 
complex number 9 + 12i, the result would be 3 + 4i. Defined as 
sqrt(z) = sqrt(r) * e^(i*theta/2)<br> <br>
